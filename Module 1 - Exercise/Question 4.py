# Check whether the following elements are member of the following set A={2,4,6,8,10}:
# (i) 3, (ii) 12, (iii) 6, (iv) Calculate the length of A

# Define the set A
A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

# Check if 3 is a member of set A
is_3_in_A = 3 in A

# Check if 12 is a member of set A
is_12_in_A = 12 in A

# Check if 6 is a member of set A
is_6_in_A = 6 in A

# Calculate the length of set A
length_of_A = len(A)

# Print the results
print("Is 3 a member of set A:", is_3_in_A)
print("Is 12 a member of set A:", is_12_in_A)
print("Is 6 a member of set A:", is_6_in_A)
